usage
=====
build
-----

`$ sudo ./build`

run
---
After the build has completed, you can now run the container.

The run command will start the container and display the output to the screen (good for troubleshooting):

`$ sudo ./run`

You can also run the container as a daemon:

`$ sudo ./daemon`

If you need to make changes in the container before starting the process:

`$ sudo ./shell`
